# asprin
> A general framework for qualitative and quantitative optimization in answer set programming.

## Description
`asprin` is a general framework for optimization in ASP that allows:
* computing optimal stable models of logic programs with preferences, and
* defining new preference types in a very easy way.
Some preference types (`subset`, `pareto`...) are already defined in `asprin`'s library,
but many more can be defined simply writing a logic program.

For a formal description of `asprin`, please read our [paper](http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/pdfformat/brderosc15a.pdf) ([bibtex](http://www.cs.uni-potsdam.de/wv/bibtex/brderosc15a.bib)).

Starting with version 3, `asprin` is documented in the [Potassco guide](https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases/).
Older versions are documented in the [Potassco guide on Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/potassco/files/guide/).


## Usage
```bash
$ asprin [number_of_models] [options] [files]
```
By default, `asprin` loads its library `asprin_lib.lp`. This may be disabled with option `--no-asprin-lib`.

Option `--help` prints help. 

Options `--approximation=weak` and `--approximation=heuristic` activate solving modes different than the basic ones, 
and are often faster than it.

Option `--meta=query` can be used to compute optimal models that contain the atom `query`. 

Options `--meta=simple` or `--meta=combine` should be used to compute many optimal models using
non stratified preference programs (in `asprin`'s library this can only happen with CP nets, see below).

Option `--on-opt-heur` can be used to enumerate diverse (or similar) optimal stable models. 
For example, try with `--on-opt-heur=+,p,1,false --on-opt-heur=-,p,1,true`.

Option `--improve-limit` can be used to enumerate close to optimal stable models.
For example, try with `--improve-limit 2,1000`.

## Building
`asprin` requires Python (version 2.7 is tested), and 
the python module of [clingo](https://github.com/potassco/clingo) (version 5.2.2 is tested),
whose directory should be in the environment variable `PYTHONPATH`:

* On Windows, 
you can download the corresponding [clingo release](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases/download/v5.2.2/clingo-5.2.2-win64.zip), 
uncompress it in some directory `dir`,
and set `PYTHONPATH` to `dir\clingo-5.2.2-win64\python-api` (with `set PYTHONPATH=dir\clingo-5.2.2-win64\python-api`).

* On Mac, 
you can download the corresponding [clingo release](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases/download/v5.2.2/clingo-5.2.2-macos-10.9.tar.gz), 
uncompress it in some directory `dir`,
and set `PYTHONPATH` to `dir\clingo-5.2.2-macos-10.9\python-api` (with `export PYTHONPATH=dir\clingo-5.2.2-macos-10.9\python-api`).

* On Unix, you can download the [source code](https://github.com/potassco/clingo/archive/v5.2.2.tar.gz), 
build it following the instructions in `INSTALL.md`, and set `PYTHONPATH` accordingly.

`asprin` can be installed with [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) via
```pip install asprin```. 

For a local installation, add option ```--user```.
In this case, setting environment variable `PYTHONUSERBASE` to `dir` before running `pip`, 
`asprin` will be installed in `dir/bin/asprin`.

If that does not work, 
you can always download the sources from [here](https://github.com/potassco/asprin/releases/download/v3.0.3/asprin-3.0.3.tar.gz) in some directory `dir`,
and run `asprin` with `python dir/asprin/asprin/asprin.py`.

System tests may be run with ```asprin --test``` and ```asprin --test --all```.

For older releases, please click [here](https://pypi.org/project/asprin/#history).

```asprin``` uses the ply library, version 3.11,
which is bundled in [asprin/src/spec_parser/ply](https://github.com/potassco/asprin/tree/master/asprin/src/spec_parser/ply),
and was retrieved from http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/.

## CP nets

`asprin` preference library implements the preference type `cp`,
that stands for *CP nets*.

CP nets where introduced in the following paper:
*  Craig Boutilier, Ronen I. Brafman, Carmel Domshlak, Holger H. Hoos, David Poole:
CP-nets: A Tool for Representing and Reasoning with Conditional Ceteris Paribus Preference Statements. 
J. Artif. Intell. Res. 21: 135-191 (2004)

Propositional preference elements of type `cp` have one of the following forms:
1. `a >> not a || { l1; ...; ln }`, or
2. `not a >> a || { l1, ..., ln }`

where `a` is an atom and `l1`, ..., `ln` are literals.

The semantics is defined using the notion of flips.
Let `X` and `Y` be two interpretations of a logic program.
There is an improving flip from `X` to `Y` if 
`Y` is the union of `X` and `{a}` and there is some rule of the form (1) such that `X` and `Y` satisfy all `li`'s, or
`Y` is `X` minus `{a}` and there is some rule of the form (2) such that `X` and `Y` satisfy all `li`'s.
Then `W` is better than `Z` if there is a sequence of improving flips from `W` to `Z`.
A CP net is consistent if there is no interpretation `X` such that `X` is better than `X`.


We provide various encoding and solving techniques for CP nets, 
that can be applied depending on the structure of the CP net.
For tree-like CP nets, see example [cp_tree.lp](https://github.com/potassco/asprin/blob/master/asprin/examples/cp_tree.lp).
For acyclic CP nets, see example [cp_acyclic.lp](https://github.com/potassco/asprin/blob/master/asprin/examples/cp_acyclic.lp).
For general CP nets, see example [cp_general.lp](https://github.com/potassco/asprin/blob/master/asprin/examples/cp_general.lp).

`asprin` implementation of CP nets is correct only for consistent CP nets.
Note that tree-like and acyclic CP nets are always consistent, but this does not hold in general.
